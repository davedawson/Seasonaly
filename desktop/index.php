        <p>In an attempt to eat fresher food, I realized that I don’t know what’s fresh. So I compiled a list of fruits and veggies and when they’re in season.</p>
        <p>Just pull this site up when you’re at the grocery store to display a list of produce that is in season that day. </p>
        <p>Right now, the list only works for the greater New York area. But more areas are coming soon! </p>
